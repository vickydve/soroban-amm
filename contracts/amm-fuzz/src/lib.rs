//! Fuzz / property-based tests for AMM swap invariants.
//!
//! Verifies that:
//!   1. The x*y=k invariant holds (k never decreases) after every swap.
//!   2. Fee calculations are correct across all valid fee tiers (0–10 000 bps).
//!   3. No integer overflow or rounding error causes incorrect output.
//!   4. The constant-product output formula never returns a value ≥ reserve_out.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   cargo test -p amm-fuzz
//!
//! Each proptest property runs with 10 000 cases by default (see ProptestConfig).
